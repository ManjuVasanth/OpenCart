# OpenCart
OpenCart is ecommerce domain project. Here I am using the Hybrid framework. This includes TDD and POM. POM concept is used so that every WebElement in particular page are segregated into particular class using @FindBy annotations of TestNG and we write the actions of the WebElement in the same class itself.
